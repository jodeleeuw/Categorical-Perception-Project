	<p>In this experiment, some groups learned to classify the alien cells into two categories while others did not.  
	In some cases, the differences between the cells were small and subtle, while for others, the differences were large and obvious.  
	We are interested in how these factors affect different kinds of judgments of a larger set of the cells as this may help us understand 
	more about category learning and test competing theories.</p>
